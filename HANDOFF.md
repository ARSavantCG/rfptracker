RFP Tracker — Savant Portal Integration
Project Handoff Document
Session Date: April 14, 2026

What this project is:
A commercial real estate RFP management system built for Bridge Industrial, hosted at rfptracker.app on Replit with a Neon PostgreSQL database. The codebase is TypeScript full-stack — React/Vite frontend, Express backend, Drizzle ORM.
GitHub: https://github.com/ARSavantCG/rfptracker

What was accomplished this session:

✅ Seeded master_categories table to 32 categories (added Dock Equipment, Flooring & Wall Finishes, Office Build-out, Warehouse Lighting, Permits & Fees, Insurance & Bond, Contractor Fee/OH&P, Contingency, Interior Storefront/Glazed Partitions, Cabinetry, Solid Surface Countertops, Remote Restroom(s))
✅ Category dropdown on bid line items — compact 160px dropdown per untagged row in bid-view-modal.tsx; tagged rows show blue pill + clear button; selection PATCHes /api/bid-line-items/:id/mapping
✅ Keyword auto-suggest on bid modal load — keywords (general conditions, overhead/profit, insurance, bond, permit, fee) match description text and pre-populate dropdown with amber styling + ✓ confirm button; user must confirm before saving
✅ Grouped import rollup in evaluation-budget.tsx — tagged items grouped by masterCategoryId (summed totals, category name as description, unit "ls"); untagged items pass through individually
✅ PDF bid import "first clean table only" detection — server/pdf-parser.ts now drops junk rows (blank, pure-number, parentheses-only, header phrases like "QTY UNIT", "PRICE", "SHELL AREA", "OTHER AREA", "TOTAL AREA") and truncates at end of first contiguous clean block (3 consecutive non-clean rows triggers cutoff)
✅ Stripped all 55 debug console.log statements from evaluation-budget.tsx (105 lines removed including multi-line objects for parking calc, electrical calc, tiered pricing, auto-calculations, drag operations)

## Recently Completed

✅ **Phase 1 — Quarterly Pricing Intelligence** (complete)
- `QuarterlyPricingPanel` component: quote table, add-quote form, price intelligence summary cards, active price mode selector
- Integrated into ROM scope items modal with BarChart2 toggle button on every TI and non-TI row
- ROM calculator uses `activePrice` (catalog / contractor / manual override) in both calculations and HTML export
- PATCH `/api/scope-items/:id/pricing-mode` route with `selectedContractorName` and `manualOverridePrice` fields

✅ **Phase 2 — Project Actuals & Historical Intelligence** (complete)
- `project_actuals` and `project_actual_line_items` database tables (full CRUD + benchmarks intelligence endpoint)
- Historical Import page (`/historical-import`): manual entry tab + CSV import tab with downloadable template
- Benchmarks Dashboard (`cost-benchmarks.tsx`): Low/Avg/High $/SF by category × area type, spread % color coding, ROM diff comparison, one-click "Update ROM Price"
- ROM Pilot Benchmarks tab added alongside existing estimates list
- Record Project Actuals section at the bottom of every Evaluation Budget view — pre-populated from RFP + budget data, Save / Skip options, success state with Benchmarks link

Known issues / next session fix list:
🔧 Bug Fixes:

1. MG Westside Bldg B split bays need dock door counts added to bay records
2. ✅ RESOLVED — AI bid analysis debugging logs now live in production (API key presence, bid collection ID, Claude raw response first 500 chars). Ready to reproduce and diagnose "Analysis failed" in next desktop session.
3. ✅ RESOLVED — /api/version route already had try/catch fallback in place; confirmed no longer 500ing.
10. Fix GitHub CI/CD Pipeline — update .github/workflows so security scan and tests pass after routes refactoring, or simplify if automated testing is not a current priority

🏗️ Features to Build:
1. Master Cost Library — unified pricing database replacing ROM Scope Items
2. Workletter/broker PDF parser — Claude extracts scope checklist at Step 1
3. Email/notes parser — Claude captures construction requirements from team emails
4. ✅ COMPLETE — Historical cost benchmarking — $/SF by category from clean bid data (Phase 2)
5. Bulk-confirm all keyword suggestions in bid view modal (one-click "Accept All" button)

## Next Session Priority
1. Test quarterly pricing panel end to end with real Excel Construction quotes
2. Enter first historical project actuals via manual entry
3. Verify benchmarks dashboard populates correctly
4. Begin bid line item tagging feature

How to start next session:
Paste this into Claude:
"I'm continuing work on the RFP Tracker / Savant Portal project. Here is the handoff document from our last session: [paste this document]. Let's start with [item from fix list]."

Key architectural decisions made:

Token auth only — no sessions (stored as auth-token with hyphen in localStorage)
AI features locked to admin.access permission only
Split bays use rentableSquareFootage field, not squareFootage
Property parking is proportional: (tenantSF / totalPropertySF) * propertyParking
PATCH /api/bid-line-items/:id/mapping requires BOTH masterCategoryId and isCleanData — always pass item.isCleanData ?? false
master_categories table: 32 rows; columns: id, name, description, sort_order, created_at
Cost amounts stored inconsistently — some as text strings, some as integer cents (future cleanup needed)
PDF parser clean-block cutoff: 3 consecutive non-clean rows after first clean block starts = end of table
